How I describe myself
======
I am a molecular environmental biologist, working on how organisms respond to environmental change. My work integrates across levels of biological organization, from detailed studies of genetics, to what those mean for organismal phenotypes, and how that translates into population-level changes in distribution and fitness. 

My background
======
I fell in love with insects when I was very young - I spent hours sitting in front of a neighbor's yard watching ladybugs and figuring out their lifecycle, catching grasshoppers in sunny spots in meadows, and raising swallowtail caterpillars I collected from neighborhood fennel bushes. From the age of 5 or so, I always said that I wanted to be an entomologist when I grew up. Inspired by an active imagination (I remember picturing myself tromping through rainforests finding new insects), 5-year-old me would be so excited to know what I'm doing now! As I got older, and started learning about climate change, that became another of the key passions in my life. Now, I study how climate change affects arthropods, and I think it's the coolest combination of passions I could have ever dreamed of.
